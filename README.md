# Personal-Profile-Webpage
# 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to create a clean, interactive personal profile webpage using fundamental web development technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project introduces basic layout design, styling, and user interaction to provide a simple yet professional digital introduction of oneself.


# 🛠️ Tools Used

HTML5 – Structure of the webpage (index.html)

CSS3 – Styling and layout design (style.css)

JavaScript  – Basic interactivity (script.js)

Text Editor – (e.g., VS Code or Notepad++)

Browser – To run and test the webpage (Chrome, Edge, etc.)


# 🧾 Steps Included

HTML Development (index.html)

Structured the page with headings, an image, a paragraph introducing the user, a button, and a contact form.

Linked the external stylesheet (style.css) and script file (script.js).

CSS Styling (style.css)

Styled the body with background color and padding.

Customized fonts, alignment, and added styling for image, form, and button elements.

Ensured the form and photo are responsive and centered using margin and auto properties.

JavaScript Interaction (script.js)

Created a sayHello() function that prompts the user for their name and displays a greeting message using alert().

Integration

The button in HTML triggers the JavaScript function.

External resources (style.css and script.js) are linked properly.


# 📊 Analysis

Functionality: All components load properly in a browser. The button triggers the expected JavaScript alert.

Design: Simple and clean layout using light blue background, central alignment, and box shadows for form visibility.

Responsiveness: While not fully responsive for mobile, the centered layout ensures usability on standard desktops.

Accessibility: Basic placeholders and labels are present but could be improved with ARIA tags and responsive images.


# 🔍 Key Insights

Separating structure (HTML), style (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) improves maintainability.

A small script (sayHello()) demonstrates the power of JavaScript to create user interaction.

Styling details like border-radius, box-shadow, and font colors enhance the look and feel significantly.

Image paths need to be carefully managed—embedding local paths like C:\Users\... will not work on web servers; it should use relative or hosted image URLs instead.


# ✅ Conclusion

This project serves as a foundational exercise in personal branding and frontend web development. It covers the core web technologies in a meaningful way and showcases how a basic webpage can combine structure, style, and interactivity. Future improvements could include responsive design, better form validation, and hosted image integration for full deployment.
